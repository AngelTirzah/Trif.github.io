<P> I love painting <br> 

Painting has been a <b>hobby </b> I have embraced for quite some time. <br>
Ever since I took the paintbrush  and just crafted something on paper, I have never looked back on it.<br>
<u>Painting has been a hobby that gives me joy </u>because I can draw my <i>imaginations </i> into an art piece and make the best out of it.  </P>
<p> But I do have other Hobbies too       .................  H<sub>2</sub>O...... A<sup>3</sup></p>
